#watchout
Watchout is a game that was built on D3.js. Try to move the purple circle by trying to avoid those shurikens! Current Score resets when you collide with a shuriken.


This project was worked on with a pair, where we designed an asteroid game using D3.js
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).
